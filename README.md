Hi there 👋 lukeJordan1

- 💬 About me:  I am a First Year Computer Science student
- 🔭 I am currently working on:  C++ coding projects and assignments, building cyber security hardware and robotics projects including a robot car and arm.

🌱 I am currently studying the below topics at University:
  
  C++ programming - 📫 I have completed the following coding challenges:
      
      Monthly Income: a programme designed to calculate an employee's basic pay, bonus and medical allowance using arithmetic          operators, stream manipulators and various other aspects of C++
     
      Height in Meters: Creation of a programme to receive the height of a person in imperial measurements and convert to metric
      
      Annual High Temperatures: Calulate temperatures across multiple US cities and provide an average temperature
      
      How much paint: A programme to calculate the amount of paint required to cover a fence
      
      Burger Stall: Assess a food business' sales for the day
      
      Project Hours: calculate the amount of hours worked on a project for two employees
     
      House Budget: Calculate the typical costs involved in maintaining a property
      
      Area of a Triangle: Calculate the area of a triangle conforming to strict mathematical formulae
      
      Distance Travelled: Present the distance travelled of a vehicle using loops and if conditions

  Information assurance and security:
   -Decryption Techniques Report
      - Written report to solve several Vigenere and Caesar Shift Ciphers, illustarte techniques used and assess validity against modern day encryption techniques. I wrote a further appendix about quantum technology and its impact upon cryptography. 
   - Cyber security:
      - Use of TryHackMe labs to understand Malware and other aspects of network security.
      - Use of Immersive labs to consolidate learning. 
   - SQL Database and report:
      - Built a database using Oracle Apex for a University Bookstore.
      - Produced report on how I completed the task and displayed queries to demonstrate functionality of a database. 
  
- 👯 I am looking to collaborate on:  Coding challenges, CTF and hardware including robotics projects

Further technical skills: 
-  OSINT: Ability to carry out Open Source investigative analysis which conforms to UK RIPA legislation
-  Critical risk analysis and geopolitics literate: I have previously completed a level 5 diploma in International Relations with The Open University. I have a rich professional background involving work across multiple countries, some of which have suffered conflict or humanitarian disasters. 
-  Trained cultural advisor and analyst.
-  Trained Spanish linguist.
-  Trained information manager with experience of directing teams of analysts.
-  Strategic Management and Leadership PGDIP: I am currently one module from completing this qualification.
     - So far this has enabled me to better understand business terminology and processes. It also provides me with greater insight into various aspects of a business model to understand how technology           can support, change and develop a business.  
  
Aspirations
 - I wish to develop my programming and overarching Computer Science career towards quantum computing and robotics.
 - I enjoy learning about quantum mechanics and am currently working towards improving my Maths to be able to better understand the intricacies of quantum theory and accompanying technologies.
